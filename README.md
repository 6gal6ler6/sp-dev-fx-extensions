# spfx-ext-directlink
This is a SPFx solution which gives the end-user the ability to just get a regular, simple link to a document or folder in the modern SharePoint document libraries.

The solution is built with:
* A SPFx Extension (v.1.7.1) with tenant wide deployment option
* A React component inside an Extension
* Additional Office UI Fabric Components, such as Icon, TextField, Button and Callout to ensure a consistent UX
* CSS animations on the CheckMark icon

This is a working prototype. #sharingiscaring
